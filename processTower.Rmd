title: "Process Tall Tower Data"

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook to process data 
from the Tall Tower database. This notebook requires data in .csv format derived 
from following repository:
https://github.com/marcosp-araujo/Tower2csv. This notebooks reads the .csv file
and computes the average value between different sensors at the same height
for each parameter (humidity, pressure, wind direction and speed). Let's start 
by simply reading the data.
```{r}
# Reading the cvs file as a data frame ###########
df <- read.csv(file="2009.csv", header=TRUE)
```

Now, we continue by visualizing the data frame. If browsing the data frame by clicking in the black right arrow, it's possible to see that there is more than one sensor for each parameter. For instance, there are three wind 
direction sensors at 116 m (S1, S2 and S3), namely, wdiragl116S1, wdiragl116S2 
and wdiragl116S3. 
```{r}
head(df)
```

Next, a function to process the data named "processData" is defined. It averages data from different sensors at the same height. This function requires 
two inputs: (i) a data frame, (ii) and a list of heights. It is worth noting that the average can be directly computed because 
the Tall  Tower database has been pre-processed and the mast shadow effect was previously fixed.
```{r}
## FUNCTION TO PROCESS DATA ####################################################
processData <- function(df,allHeights){
  
# Defining the sensors' names
  allSensors = list("huragl","psagl","taagl","wdiragl","windagl")
# New data frame to receive processed data
  dfProcessed <- df["time"]
# Converting time data from character format to timestamp - only need for plotting
  #dfProcessed$time <- strptime(dfProcessed$time, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") 
  
  for (sensor in allSensors){
    for (height in allHeights){
    # Sensor full name
      sensorFullName = paste(sensor, height, sep = "")
    # All columns from "sensor" at the same height 
      columns = grep(sensorFullName, colnames(df), value = TRUE)
      
    # Checking if the columns was found
      if (length(columns) == 0) { # If none columns was found
        print(paste(sensorFullName," column was not found"))
        next # Continue with the next iteration step
      }
      print(paste("Reading", toString(columns)))
      data_tmp = df[columns]  # Data from "sensor"
      
    # Computing the mean value between different sensors at the same height
      dfProcessed[sensorFullName] <- rowMeans(data_tmp, na.rm = T)
    }
  }
  return(dfProcessed)
}
```

 In the next code cell/chunk we call the function that displays which sensor was found.
```{r}
## Calling processData function ##############################################
allHeights = list(21,70,116) #list of heights
dfProcessed <- processData(df,allHeights)
```

In the following, we visualize the processed data.
```{r}
head(dfProcessed)
```

Finally, the processed data frame can be saved or exported as .csv file by using the following command lines
```{r}
## Exporting dataframe to a .csv file ##########################################
saveFileName = paste(getwd(),'/',"2009_avg",".csv", sep = "")
write.csv(dfProcessed, saveFileName, row.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE, 
          fileEncoding = "UTF-8")
```
